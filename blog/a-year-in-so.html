<p>365 Consecutive Days On Stack Overflow. Why?
<p>There was a trend a while ago for photographers to announce they 
were doing &#8216;a 365&#8217;. They meant they were going to take a picture
every day, and post it online. Soon their photostreams were full of 
badly instagrammed food and&nbsp;selfies. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently completed a slightly different 365. Every day for the
past 365 days I&#8217;ve checked the <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>
site. StackOverflow (henceforth &#8216;<span class="caps">SO</span>&#8217;) is a question-and-answer site for
programming questions. Its one of the
<a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> collection of
question-and-answer sites for asking just about anything. Computing, 
language, <span class="caps">TV</span> and movies, parenting, religion, poker, and bicycles are just a 
few of the component&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>At the 2011 <a href="http://web.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/">R User
Meeting</a> I did a
lightning talk suggesting we take R programming questions over to <span class="caps">SO</span>
and leave the R-help mailing list for announcements and more opinionated
forms of discussion. Although I can&#8217;t claim that to be the cause, 
traffic on the mailing list has declined and the number of questions
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">tagged R</a> is now over
seventy&nbsp;thousand.</p>
<p>I think it was back in about March that I noticed I&#8217;d not missed a day
on <span class="caps">SO</span> since November. A couple of months later I realised again I hadn&#8217;t broken that run.
By the time I was off away to Bergen in Norway for a week in July I was 
consciously trying to keep it going. Thanks to hotel and airport
Wifi I managed to check <span class="caps">SO</span> every day. I&#8217;ve probably only had a couple
of weekends away this past year so its never been a problem. I can 
check <span class="caps">SO</span> on my phone over a data connection if I need. So I did. Then
a couple of days ago the consecutive days counter clicked over to 365 
and then to&nbsp;366.</p>
<p>What does that all mean? Well, for one it indicates how connected we
are. The internet was there every day for me for a year. Along with
reading and writing on <span class="caps">SO</span> I checked my email, tweeted, read the news,
and probably did some work&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>But what did I do on <span class="caps">SO</span>? I can check. <span class="caps">SO</span> has a data explorer where you 
can build a query and download a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file of metadata about your posts.
Load that into R and summaries are&nbsp;easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>I asked a grand total of five&nbsp;questions. </li>
<li>Four of them had answers I felt were&nbsp;acceptable.</li>
<li>I answered 300&nbsp;questions.</li>
<li>The people who asked the questions accepted 171 of my answers as the&nbsp;solution.</li>
<li>There are 84 questions still waiting for the asker to accept an answer. That might never&nbsp;happen.</li>
<li>The remaining 45 had another answer accepted as the best&nbsp;answer. </li>
</ul>
<p>I can also check the tags for the questions I&#8217;ve answered. Tags are used to 
categorise questions on <span class="caps">SO</span>, and a question can have several tags assigned. 
Of those 300 questions I&nbsp;answered:</p>
<ul>
<li>there were 298 unique&nbsp;tags.</li>
<li>288 questions had the <code>r</code> tag.</li>
<li>10 had the <code>python</code> tag.</li>
<li>15 were tagged <code>ggplot2</code> and/or <code>plot</code></li>
<li><code>igraph</code> had 9 tagged&nbsp;questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there&#8217;s a long long tail, with 223 tags making a single appearance,
including things like <code>ruby</code>, <code>julia-lang</code>, <code>java</code>, and <code>fortran</code>.</p>
<p>As well as questions and answers, I&#8217;ve probably made even more comments
on questions and answers. The quality can be appalling, but people
soon learn the netiquette. A bunch of us hang out in the R chat room
on <span class="caps">SO</span>, sending a flurry of downvotes or close-requests to anything
that needs improving or&nbsp;removing. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve occasionally popped over to some of the other <span class="caps">SE</span> sites. The <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/"><span class="caps">GIS</span>
Stack Exchange</a> is a good place to ask
and learn about the latest mapping software. The <a href="http://datascience.stackexchange.com/">Data
Science</a> site is however a bit
rubbish, full of inappropriate questions or things that return
opinionated answers or where answers would be impossible to squeeze
into a text box. Its currently a &#8216;beta&#8217; site on <span class="caps">SE</span>, and I don&#8217;t know
if it will survive. Its greatest utility at the moment is as a place
to dump poor machine-learning questions posted on&nbsp;<span class="caps">SO</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learnt a lot this year. I find <span class="caps">SO</span> is a great place to learn, by
answering questions more than asking them. You can also learn by 
seeing what the other answers are. This year has been one of great
debate between the <code>data.table</code> crowd and the <code>dplyr/pipes</code> mob. Some
people have been posting answers using base R code, data.table, and
dplyr solutions, with benchmarking. The winner in this battle is all
of us, since we have many possible solutions for an infinite number
of&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how long this run will last. Now I&#8217;ve written this up I
could intentionally avoid <span class="caps">SO</span> tomorrow. But there might just be one
interesting&nbsp;question&#8230;</p></p>

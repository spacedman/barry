<h1>My Work</h1>
<p>
My first research job was an ESRC-funded project on integrating
spatial statistics with GIS, with applications in disease epidemiology.
We explored ways of putting advanced spatial statistics into a GIS,
but with the lack of even simple statistics in the GIS, we ended up
putting spatial statistics into a statistics system.
</p>
<p>
Since then I have worked on many other projects, most of them
applied data analysis combined with software development. I work closely
with data providers and scientists to understand and model their data
appropriately, and to produce results they can interpret in order to
answer their research questions.
</p>
<p>
Although most of my research projects have been related to disease mapping
or spatial epidemiology, I have also worked on other applications, such as 
modelling butterfly behaviour and time-series analysis.
</p>

I'm always interested in new collaborative opportunities - if you have 
any ideas where we can work together, <a href="mailto:b.rowlingson@gmail.com">send
me an email</a> or <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>

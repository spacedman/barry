<h1>Teaching Work</h1>

{% call parts.articleRight('Teaching at Lancaster',  'lancaster.jpg','lancaster') %}
<p>Although I'm funded through research grant income, I still do some teaching at Lancaster. 
Recently I delivered an MSc module on Environmental Epidemiology for the MSc Statistics students,
and a lecture and workshop for a Biology course on computer modelling of disease spread.
</p>
<p>
This year I was invited to give a lecture on Open Source GIS to the third year undergraduate
GIS students after the previous year's cohort asked the course convener to include it as a topic
for future students.

<p>
The workshop sessions before the annual UseR! meetings are always popular. I was accepted to 
present a half-day session on Spatial Data Handling in R at the <a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/UseR-2012">UseR! 2012 Meeting</a> in Nashville.
</p>
<p>There was a good attendance at the workshop, and it was a great opportunity to talk to a number of end-users of 
spatial R software and get ideas for the further development of packages.

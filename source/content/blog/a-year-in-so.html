365 Consecutive Days On Stack Overflow. Why?

{%- endmark %}

{% filter markdown %}

There was a trend a while ago for photographers to announce they 
were doing 'a 365'. They meant they were going to take a picture
every day, and post it online. Soon their photostreams were full of 
badly instagrammed food and selfies. 

I've recently completed a slightly different 365. Every day for the
past 365 days I've checked the [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
site. StackOverflow (henceforth 'SO') is a question-and-answer site for
programming questions. Its one of the
[Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) collection of
question-and-answer sites for asking just about anything. Computing, 
language, TV and movies, parenting, religion, poker, and bicycles are just a 
few of the component sites.

At the 2011 [R User
Meeting](http://web.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/) I did a
lightning talk suggesting we take R programming questions over to SO
and leave the R-help mailing list for announcements and more opinionated
forms of discussion. Although I can't claim that to be the cause, 
traffic on the mailing list has declined and the number of questions
[tagged R](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) is now over
seventy thousand.

I think it was back in about March that I noticed I'd not missed a day
on SO since November. A couple of months later I realised again I hadn't broken that run.
By the time I was off away to Bergen in Norway for a week in July I was 
consciously trying to keep it going. Thanks to hotel and airport
Wifi I managed to check SO every day. I've probably only had a couple
of weekends away this past year so its never been a problem. I can 
check SO on my phone over a data connection if I need. So I did. Then
a couple of days ago the consecutive days counter clicked over to 365 
and then to 366.

What does that all mean? Well, for one it indicates how connected we
are. The internet was there every day for me for a year. Along with
reading and writing on SO I checked my email, tweeted, read the news,
and probably did some work too.

But what did I do on SO? I can check. SO has a data explorer where you 
can build a query and download a CSV file of metadata about your posts.
Load that into R and summaries are easy:

 * I asked a grand total of five questions. 
 * Four of them had answers I felt were acceptable.
 * I answered 300 questions.
 * The people who asked the questions accepted 171 of my answers as the solution.
 * There are 84 questions still waiting for the asker to accept an answer. That might never happen.
 * The remaining 45 had another answer accepted as the best answer. 

I can also check the tags for the questions I've answered. Tags are used to 
categorise questions on SO, and a question can have several tags assigned. 
Of those 300 questions I answered:

 * there were 298 unique tags.
 * 288 questions had the `r` tag.
 * 10 had the `python` tag.
 * 15 were tagged `ggplot2` and/or `plot`
 * `igraph` had 9 tagged questions.

Then there's a long long tail, with 223 tags making a single appearance,
including things like `ruby`, `julia-lang`, `java`, and `fortran`.

As well as questions and answers, I've probably made even more comments
on questions and answers. The quality can be appalling, but people
soon learn the netiquette. A bunch of us hang out in the R chat room
on SO, sending a flurry of downvotes or close-requests to anything
that needs improving or removing. 

I've occasionally popped over to some of the other SE sites. The [GIS
Stack Exchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com/) is a good place to ask
and learn about the latest mapping software. The [Data
Science](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/) site is however a bit
rubbish, full of inappropriate questions or things that return
opinionated answers or where answers would be impossible to squeeze
into a text box. Its currently a 'beta' site on SE, and I don't know
if it will survive. Its greatest utility at the moment is as a place
to dump poor machine-learning questions posted on SO.

I've learnt a lot this year. I find SO is a great place to learn, by
answering questions more than asking them. You can also learn by 
seeing what the other answers are. This year has been one of great
debate between the `data.table` crowd and the `dplyr/pipes` mob. Some
people have been posting answers using base R code, data.table, and
dplyr solutions, with benchmarking. The winner in this battle is all
of us, since we have many possible solutions for an infinite number
of problems.

I don't know how long this run will last. Now I've written this up I
could intentionally avoid SO tomorrow. But there might just be one
interesting question...
